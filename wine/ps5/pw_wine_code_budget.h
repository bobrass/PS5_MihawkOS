/* How much converted code a helper keeps (the code cache, pw_wine_dmem_ps5.c; docs/FLEXIBLE_MEMORY.md). The owner's rule
 * (2026-10-25): "64MiB always on for Steam and launchers", and a smarter default for everything else; changed on 2026-10-27
 * to fix Big Picture's stutter: "also let Steam and launchers be raised on real thrash", by the same rule as a game.
 *
 *   WINE_PS5_CODE_BUDGET_MIB set  that budget, fixed, for any program (0 is off)
 *   a listed image                64 MiB to start, raised as a game's is on real thrash: Steam and the common launchers
 *                                 and their browser helpers (pw_code_budget_listed), whose code is large and mostly cold
 *   any other program (games)     64 MiB to start (WINE_PS5_CODE_BUDGET_START_MIB for a test), raised PW_CODE_BUDGET_STEP_MIB at a time, up to
 *                                 PW_CODE_BUDGET_MAX_MIB, whenever it re-converts PW_CODE_BUDGET_THRASH_KIB of code
 *                                 it evicted, within PW_CODE_BUDGET_WINDOW_MS; never lowered
 *
 * The raise's threshold, measured on the base PS5 (2026-10-25):
 * - The 2D game with 16 MiB of its 23 MB of code evicted 1,571 clusters, ~2 MB per 10 s, and its worst p99 went from
 *   18 to 33 ms (fmem-isaac-b16-2026-10-25-01).
 * - At 64 MiB it evicted none and kept its frame times (fmem-isaac-b64-2026-10-25-01).
 * So 1 MiB re-converted in 10 s raises a game's budget before its frames pay for it.
 * Only clusters that come back a second time or more count: the Direct3D 12 game at a fixed 64 MiB re-converted 3.4 MiB
 * as its loading ended and 160 KiB in the 230 s of play after it, with the same frames as with no budget (116.6 against
 * 116.8 fps, p99 9.5 ms: fmem-re3-budget-64-2026-10-26-01), yet the first return of its loading code raised it to 96
 * MiB (fmem-re3-budget-default-2026-10-26-01). A cycle comes back again; a phase change does not. A thrashing game is
 * raised one cycle later than before (the 2D game at 16 MiB: an estimate of 35 s, its ~7 MiB over budget at ~2 MB per
 * 10 s).
 * Steam's web helper at 64 MiB evicted ~15 MB per 10 s with no visible cost to Steam's desktop window, which redraws at about
 * 2 frames a second. Big Picture draws at 120 Hz in that helper when it runs as one process (the Pro), and there the same
 * churn was stutter: 299 MiB came back in its first minute, 79 frames over 20 ms, against 35 with no budget (base PS5,
 * 2026-10-27, bp-a/bp-b). So a listed image is raised too, by the same rule (the owner's word of 2026-10-27: the 64 MiB
 * may be raised if it fixes the stutter); its cold churn comes back once and raises nothing.
 *
 * A re-conversion is a conversion of a cluster the cache gave back: PW_CODE_BUDGET_EVICTED addresses are remembered,
 * one slot per hash, so a collision only forgets (undercounts). No heap, no locks: the caller holds virtual_mutex. */
